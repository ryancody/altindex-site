<h4>About Us</h4>

<p>
The T&amp;C 20 team consists of four professionals with backgrounds in finance, trading, computer science, engineering and medicine. Our creation of T&amp;C 20 is to provide both an updated index that tracks value in the altcoin sector, as well as provide updated analysis, research and news on cryptocurrency developments from an investor’s view.

While trading our personal portfolios, we often found it difficult to determine if the altcoin sector was functioning as a zero-sum game or if “new money” (i.e. fiat, bitcoin, ethereum) was entering. We discovered that this knowledge is critical in making trading decisions. The T&amp;C 20 Index provides this information. Since its inception in early 2016, I have used the T&amp;C 20 Index as an analytic tool in my personal fund, the “Icarus Fund”, and have successfully traded with increasingly greater profits. It is our hope that you may find it as useful as we did.
