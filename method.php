<h4>Methodology</h4>

<div>
<p>
The T&amp;C 20 Index is based on market capitalization, and is calculated using the same methodology as the S&amp;P 500â“‡. The altcoins included in the T&amp;C 20 were chosen to track value of the overall altcoin sector. The selected altcoins are leading development and/or application in data storage, anonymity, social media platform, gaming, and token economy. Altcoins currently included in the T&amp;C 20 Index are Monero, Dash, Steem, MaidSafeCoin, NEM, Waves, DigixDAO, Factom, Stellar Lumens, Lisk, Bitshares, Emercoin, Storjcoin X, NXT, Counterparty, SiaCoin, Synereo, Stratis and GameCredits.
</p>
<p>
Weekly, the T&amp;C 20 team meets and reviews the top 50 altcoins according to coinmarketcap.com for possible inclusion in the index. Alternatively, any altcoins in the T&amp;C 20 that fail to meet the minimum criteria below for an extended period of time are removed from the index.

The last alteration to the index was made on <b>January 16th, 2017</b>, with the addition of GameCredits and Stratis. Of note, Bitcoin and Ethereum are not included in the T&C 20, as they are large currencies which are not reflective of the altcoin sector.
